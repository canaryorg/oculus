\chapter{Performance and scalability analysis}
In this section I will analyse the devised system on such aspects as general performance, ability (and ease) of scaling the system
to support larger amounts of data or to speed-up the processing times by adding more servers to the cluster.

These measurements will be made in the previously described system and backed by measurements 

\section{Scaling Hadoop}
In this section I will investigate the impact of scaling the Hadoop cluster vertically (by adding more nodes) on processing times of movies.

The task used to measure will be the longest pipeline available in the oculus system - comparing a movie, percentage wise with all other movies in the database.
This process touches a tremendous amount of data, and is also very parallelizable.

At first I measured the time to process the input movie ....
