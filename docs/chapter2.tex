\chapter{Selected technologies}
As the core of this work will focus on analysing and benchmarking usage of popular distributed system stacks, it is only fair to begin with introducing the selected components from which the system consist.

This chapter should be treated as a brief introduction into the selected technologies, as very detailed explanations and and implementation details will be provided throughout chapters \ref{chap:system-design} through \ref{chap:perf-scalability}.

\section{Hadoop DFS}
As the system will require the storage of many gigabytes (hundreds) of data the core of the system will be pretty much dominated by writing and reading to / from a datastore that contains all our reference video material.

Hadoop's \ref{hadoop} Distributed File System was designed with such thoughts in mind, and is able to scale an abstract file system over many servers, yet providing tools to make it visible as if it was one file system.
