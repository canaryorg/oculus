\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chap:conclusions}

This chapter will summarise the findings from researching, developing and scaling the system implemented as part of this thesis.

\section{Possible future development}
The discovered and tested methods have proven to be very interesting as well as quite efficient. However much more work still remains to be done. 

A very good first thing to focus on in future development would be utilising advanced compression in storing the data, so that move frames could be processed while executing one chunk of work.

\section{Conclusions}

The applied technologies have indeed been very helpful, and proved to be very elastic for different kinds of jobs related to processing large amounts of data. I was also positively surprised with the ease of Scaling Hadoop infrastructure.
