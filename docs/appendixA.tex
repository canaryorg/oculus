Hadoop's filesystem must be formated before put into use. This is achieved by issuing the \verb|-format| command to the namenode:

\begin{verbatim}
kmalawski@oculus-master > hadoop namenode -format
\end{verbatim}

It is worth pointing out that a "format" takes place only on the namenode, it does not actually touch the datab stored on the datanodes,
but instead it deleted the data stored on the namenode. The Namenode, as explained previously, stores all metadata about where a file is located,
thus, cleaning it's data makes the files stores in HDFS un-usable, since we don't know "where a file's chunks are stored".
